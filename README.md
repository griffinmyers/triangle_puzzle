triangle puzzle
===============

This is an awful brute-force solution to the [triangle-puzzle](http://www.officeplayground.com/Assets/ProductPreview/pi3000-3199/3174_peggame_1.jpg) thing where
you have pegs that jump other pegs. 

It shouldn't be used by anyone for any reason.

This code shouldn't be looked at by anyone for any reason. 

If you must, though:

    ruby game.rb

The board is set up with nodes like this:

            0
          1   2
        3   4   5
      6   7   8   9
    10  11  12  13  14  
    
    
solutions
=========

Generated solutions will look something like this: 

    ## begin solution ##
    from: 3, to: 0, over: 1
    from: 5, to: 3, over: 4
    from: 13, to: 4, over: 8
    from: 6, to: 1, over: 3
    from: 12, to: 3, over: 7
    from: 0, to: 5, over: 2
    from: 9, to: 2, over: 5
    from: 2, to: 7, over: 4
    from: 1, to: 6, over: 3
    from: 10, to: 3, over: 6
    from: 3, to: 12, over: 7
    from: 11, to: 13, over: 12
    from: 14, to: 12, over: 13
    ## end solution ##
    
Line 1 means "move peg 3 to peg 0 over peg 1"
